Revision history for Perl extension PerlMaple.

0.02 12/19/2005
    * Added SVN link 'https://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/win32maple'
      to the POD doc.
    * On the XS side, ignored MAPLE_TEXT_STATUS output so that
      PerlMaple won't return silly things like
      "bytes used=1963, alloc=719, time=0.44".
    * Emphasized that Maple's maplec.h and maplec.lib 
      must be in INC and LIB, repectively. Most of the test failure
      reports are concerning this issue.
    * Added AUTOLOAD mechanism so that any Maple functions or procedures
	  all automagically become the methods of PerlMaple objects;
    * Renamed ->eval method to ->eval_cmd so that ->eval is exactly the
	  Maple's counterpart.
	* ->eval is not backward-compatible.
	* Added optional options PrintError and RaiseError to the constructor
	* Added attribute methods PrintError and RaiseError
	* Fixed a bug concerning multiple PerlMaple instances creation
	* Added corresponding tests.
	* Tweaked the POD doc accordingly
	* Added the PerlMaple::Expression class to represents a Maple expression ASTs.
	* PerlMaple::Expression can now build full-featured Perl AST from arbitrary 
	  Maple expressions. So you can manipulate Maple expressions via data 
	  structures directly, without the burden of parsing Maple code yourself!
	* PerlMaple::Expression provides several useful mehods, such as type, expr,
	  and ops.
	* Added method to_ast to the PerlMaple class, which is construct a 
	  PerlMaple::Expression object from the given Maple expression.
	* Added ReturnAST attribute to the PerlMaple class (default off).
	* PerlMaple's AUTOLOADed methods (shortcuts for Maple functions) and the 
	  eval_cmd method will return a PerlMaple::Expression object automagically 
	  if you turn on the ReturnAST attribute.
	* Added many, many POD docs and many, many tests for the vast variety of 
	  new features.
	* Added code coverage testing results to POD docs. (Thanks to Devel::Cover.)
