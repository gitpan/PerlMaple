PerlMaple version 0.02
======================

This is a very simple interface to Waterloo's Maple software via the OpenMaple
C interface.

INSTALLATION

Currently this software is only tested on Win32. To build this module
properly, you must first have MapleSoft's Maple installed on your system
and append the paths of *maplec.h* and *maplec.lib* in your Maple 
installation to the enviroments LIB and INC respectively. Because this 
module use Maple's C interface via Inline::C.

A typical path of maplec.h is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\extern\include",
which should be appended to the INCLUDE environment. And a typical path
of maplec.lib is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\bin.win", which should be
appended to the LIB environment. These paths may be different on your
machine but do depend on your Maple's version and location.

It may be similar on UNIX, but I haven't tried that.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Prerequisites

  Waterloo's Maple software (version 9 or higher)
