PerlMaple version 0.05
======================

DESCRIPTION

Maple is a great tool for solving mathematical problems and creating
interactive technical applications provided by Maplesoft. Its power of 
symbolic calculation is extremely impressive.

This is a simple (but already powerful) Perl binding for Maple's
OpenMaple C interface. To try out this binding, you have to 
purchase and install the Maple software first:

	http://www.maplesoft.com.

The Maple software is *not* free, sigh, unlike this CPAN distribution.

INSTALLATION

Currently this software is only tested on Win32 against Maple 9.01 and
Maple 10.00, but it's believed to work with other versions higher than
9. If you get it work with a specific version of Maple, please send me
a mail and let me know. :=)

To build this module properly, you must first have Maple 9 or better 
installed on your system and append
the paths of *maplec.h* and *maplec.lib* in your Maple installation to the
environments LIB and INC respectively. Because this module use Maple's
C interface (OpenMaple) via XS.

Both maplec.h and maplec.lib (or maplec.a on Linux systems?) are
provided by your Maple installation itself. A typical path of maplec.h
is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\extern\include",
which should be appended to the INCLUDE environment. And a typical path
of maplec.lib is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\bin.win", which should be
appended to the LIB environment. These paths may be different on your
machine but do depend on your Maple's version and location.

It may be similar on Linux, but I haven't tried that.

It's already known that this library's XS part won't work with Maple 7 on
Win32. Sigh.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Prerequisites

  Waterloo's Maple software (version 9 or higher)
