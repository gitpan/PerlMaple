PerlMaple version 0.03
======================

This is a very simple interface to Waterloo's Maple software via the OpenMaple
C interface.

INSTALLATION

Currently this software is only tested on Win32. To build this module
properly, you must first have Maple 9 or better installed on your 
system and append
the paths of B<maplec.h> and B<maplec.lib> in your Maple installation to the
environments LIB and INC respectively. Because this module use Maple's
C interface via L<Inline::C>.

Both F<maplec.h> and F<maplec.lib> (or maplec.a on *NIX systems?) are
provided by your Maple installation itself. A typical path of maplec.h
is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\extern\include",
which should be appended to the INCLUDE environment. And a typical path
of maplec.lib is "C:\Program Files\Maple 9\bin.win", which should be
appended to the LIB environment. These paths may be different on your
machine but do depend on your Maple's version and location.

It may be similar on UNIX, but I haven't tried that.

It's known that this library's XS part won't work with Maple 7 on Win32.
Sigh.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
